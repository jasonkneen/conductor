# Conductor Status

Show the current status of this Conductor project.

## 1. Check Setup

If `conductor/tracks.md` doesn't exist, tell user to run `/conductor-setup` first.

## 2. Read State

- Read `conductor/tracks.md`
- List all track directories: `conductor/tracks/*/`
- Read each `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/plan.md`

## 3. Calculate Progress

For each track:
- Count total tasks (lines with `- [ ]`, `- [~]`, `- [x]`)
- Count completed `[x]`
- Count in-progress `[~]`
- Count pending `[ ]`
- Calculate percentage: (completed / total) * 100

## 4. Present Summary

Format the output like this:

```
## Conductor Status

**Active Track:** [track name] ([completed]/[total] tasks - [percent]%)
**Overall Status:** In Progress | Complete | No Active Tracks

### All Tracks
- [x] Track: ... (100% complete)
- [~] Track: ... (45% complete) ← ACTIVE
- [ ] Track: ... (0% - not started)

### Current Task
[The task marked with [~] in the active track's plan.md]

### Next Action
[The next task marked with [ ] in the active track's plan.md]

### Recent Completions
[Last 3 tasks marked [x] with their commit SHAs]
```

## 5. Suggestions

Based on status:
- If no tracks: "Run `/conductor-newtrack` to create your first track"
- If track in progress: "Run `/conductor-implement` to continue"
- If all complete: "All tracks complete! Run `/conductor-newtrack` for new work"
